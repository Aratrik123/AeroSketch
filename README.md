AeroSketch introduces a revolutionary way to create art and write digitally, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as OpenCV and MediaPipe. Unleash your creativity using nothing but your hands and gestures. Utilizing advanced computer vision algorithms, AeroSketch detects intricate hand gestures in real-time, translating them into strokes and commands on a digital canvas. Whether you're sketching, writing notes, or painting, the experience is intuitive and responsive.

## 🚀 Description

AeroSketch is a groundbreaking application designed for artists, students, and professionals who want to create and interact with digital content effortlessly. By recognizing hand gestures, it enables users to draw, paint, and write without the need for physical tools. This project integrates the power of OpenCV for computer vision and MediaPipe for hand-tracking, creating a seamless and interactive experience.

## 📋 Use Cases

- **Digital Art Creation**: Artists can draw and paint using hand gestures, allowing for a more natural and expressive form of digital art.
- **Note Taking**: Students and professionals can write notes using gestures, enhancing the speed and convenience of digital note-taking.
- **Interactive Presentations**: Presenters can use gestures to draw and annotate during live presentations, making them more engaging and interactive.
- **Educational Tools**: Educators can develop interactive learning tools that respond to students' hand gestures, making learning more dynamic.

## 🏞️ Overview

AeroSketch operates by capturing real-time video input from a camera, analyzing the hand gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe, and translating these gestures into digital strokes on a canvas. The application supports various gesture-based commands, such as selecting colors, changing brush sizes, and undoing actions, all designed to make the digital creation process as fluid and intuitive as possible.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Utilizes MediaPipe for accurate and fast hand gesture detection.
- **Gesture-Based Drawing**: Draw and write using predefined gestures.
- **Customizable Tools**: Change colors, brush sizes, and other tools through gestures.
- **Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly interface designed for seamless interaction.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **OpenCV**: For computer vision and image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand-tracking and gesture recognition.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for interactivity.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the drawing interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into
